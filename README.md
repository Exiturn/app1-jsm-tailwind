## My Process

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [AOS Library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### What I Learned

The new skills I learned in this project was the implementation
of the [AOS JS library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). While
the original figma design did not specify transitions/animations, I wanted
to add a little extra to the project and research on 
javascript animation methods.  

Working with React and TailwindCSS was not new to me
however this was great practice for putting Figma designs
into code.
